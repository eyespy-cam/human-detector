# Testing
Each unit of this project has automated testing.

# Mobile Application Tests
To run the mobile application tests, when in the directory `/human-detector/app/human-detector-app/`, you can run `npm test`.  This command will both run unit tests, and behavior tests through jest and jest-cucumber.

To run the tests, make sure to install the dependencies of the project using `npm install`.

To run only behavior tests through jest-cucumber, you can use the command `npm run testBDD` which will run all the cucumber tests with corresponding `.feature` files.
